# Get over it!
We are provided with get-over-it.jpg, a picture of a bridge and asked to find the following:
What is the name of it and whats the length of its main span to the nearest metre.

First I attempted a reverse-image search https://www.google.com/imghp?hl=en but unfortunately our challenge creator thrwated this by framing the image in a way that googles AI couldn't successfully reverse it. It does however suggest visually similar images and when we look at these we learning that the type of bridge pictured is some sort of "suspension bridge".

I looked for suspension bridge synoyms next, as suspension bridge seemed to be a super broad-arching category of bridge. From here I stumbled accross cable bridges and thought i'd google cable bridge australia.

First result was "Anzac bridge" which whilst not the correct one told me that we were on the right track. So next i decided to 
search "list of cable bridges australia" which gave me the following wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Cable-stayed_bridges_in_Australia

Realising there was only 8 to choose from and we'd already crossed out Anzac Bridge, I went through the list and found that: Eleanor Schonell Bridge matched perfectly down to the yellow sign and blue centre light.

So alas we have half the flag, now to find the other part.

I just googled "main span length Eleanor Schonell Bridge" which produced a result of 185m.

Depending on how we formatted the flag and where we obtained the main-span length we end up with one of the following 4 flags:
DUCTF{Eleanor_Schonell-183m}
DUCTF{Eleanor_Schonell-185m}
DUCTF{Eleanor_Schonell_Bridge-183m}
DUCTF{Eleanor_Schonell_Bridge-185m}
