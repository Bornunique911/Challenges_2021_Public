# (back) On the rails

We couldn't write a challenge without a reference to the Off The Rails series of challenges that we know the competitors loved so dearly last year ;).

The photo quality is quite poor, sufferring from motion blur and taken in a low resolution. Although, we are still able to make out what appears to be a station that has been graffitied, overgrown by nature and overall neglected/derelict. With this information, we are able to use a search engine to search for "abandoned" "derelict" "neglected" "overgrown" stations in Australia.

 However there are many of these and depending on your search engine of choice, you might immediately identify the station or sift through pages of results comparing the image. 
 
This challenge does require the solving of the previous challenges to know that this contact is located in the state of Victoria, which provides a large clue by narrowing down possible candidates for the station. Adding "Victoria" to your search should produce similar images of the same station regardless of search engine (although a good technique is to use multiple search engines when doing OSINT). 
 
From here, the competitor should find the name of the station in the search results amongst the photos, which is the old General Motors station in Dandenong, Victoria (see:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_railway_station). 

Again to account for a margin of error, we allowed any of the following flags:

  - DUCTF{general_motors_train_station}
  - DUCTF{general_motors}
  - DUCTF{general_motors_railway_station)
  - DUCTF{general_motors_station}
