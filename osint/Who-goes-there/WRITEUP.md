# Who goes there?

We are given a domain *646f776e756e646572.xyz* and asked to find the phone number of the individual who registered it in the format DUCTF{+61\<number>}.

Visiting the domain itself will not return any useful information. Instead, the solution is hinted at in the name "*Who* goes there?".

Performing a whois lookup of the domain *646f776e756e646572.xyz* will return full registrar data for Isa Haxmoore, including name, address, and phone number: **+61.420091337**.

Depending on your chosen formatting you may end up with one of the following two flags:
- *DUCTF{+61420091337}*
- *DUCTF{+61.420091337}*
