  _I've recently learned about graphql so I used it to build a site that lets you host markdown pages._
  _We're still developing the application and have a few upcoming beta features!_

  **The scope of this challenge is limited to the challenge domain _only_.**
  There are autogenerated links and images to domains external to ductf. These links and images are only present to add flavour to the challenge and are _NOT within scope_.
  **Do not exploit any sites outside of the ductf domain.**
