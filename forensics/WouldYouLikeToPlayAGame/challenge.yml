  My PC has been infected! I need help finding out what happened. I managed to get a memory dump, not sure if that can help you?

  In order to recover from this infection, I need the following information:

  - What is the name of the malware that infected my PC?
  - What is the name of the persistence mechanism?
  - What folder did the infection originate from? 

  Flag format: `DUCTF{lowerCaseMalwareName_persistenceName_originatingFolderName}`

  ---

  You can download the memory dump [here](https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/DownUnderCTF/JacobsPC.7z).

  The file is password protected. The password is `I83xOkTzeljDmpMmZWTi`.
