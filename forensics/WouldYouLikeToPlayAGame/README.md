My PC has been infected! I need help finding out what happened. I managed to get a memory dump, not sure if that can help you?


In order to recover from this infection, I need the following information:
   - What is the name of the malware that infected my PC?
   - What is the name of the persistence mechanism?
   - What folder did the infection originate from?


Flag format: `DUCTF{malwareName_persistenceName_originatingFolderName}`
