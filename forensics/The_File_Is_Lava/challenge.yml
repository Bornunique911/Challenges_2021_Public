description: |
  Acme Inc. has found that its internal files have been leaked to several successful phishing attacks.

  A new shared workstation recently had company files copied onto the disk for use in the office and needs to be analysed.

  DFIR specialists have found no evidence on other machines and need your help to investigate this workstation.

  Since COVID-19 has closed the office, find the forensic image here - https://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/DownUnderCTF/

  ---

  To give everyone a chance to download the files, the image is encrypted and the password will be released with the second challenge drop .

  The PIN code for the windows machine is `2021`.

  To decrypt the file, use any bash emulator with gpg installed and use the following command:

  ```
  gpg --output lava.ova --decrypt The_file_is_lava.ova.gpg
  ```
  
  Note: after the command is executed, you will be prompted with the passphrase that will be released later.

  It is recommended that you use virtual box to import this machine after it has been decrypted.
