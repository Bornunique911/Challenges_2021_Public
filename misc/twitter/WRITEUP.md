This is just meant to be a fun little challenge involving our twitter @DownUnderCTF :)

If we take this photo as an example in the background of this graphic (https://twitter.com/DownUnderCTF/status/1437312644860370953/photo/1) you can see we have used our old flags from DUCTF 2020.

However, in the background of our Twitter prize post graphic (https://twitter.com/DownUnderCTF/status/1436141450509500428/photo/1). You can see one of the flags is not like the others! It is located in the bottom right hand corner.

Flag: DUCTF{EYES_ON_THE_PRIZES_TWITTER}
