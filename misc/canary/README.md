# Canary

**Author:** 247CTF.com

**Difficulty:** Moderate

_Can you sneak the secret CTF code past the canary hidden in the challenge mine?_

## Description
The challenge requires you to set a specific string in a buffer. If the string is set in the correct location, you receive the flag.

However, a canary value is also set _before_ the string and if the canary value is not valid, you wonâ€™t receive the flag.

In order to write the string at the specific location, you first need to overwrite the canary - which means you need to know the canary's value in order to solve the challenge.

The canary is calculated on each request based on the RC4 algorithm (initialised with a random, unpredictable key).  To generate the canary - for each request, RC4 is called on 2 buffers of zero'd memory.

The RC4 algorithm has a bug - the swap function uses xor swap, however there is no check to verify whether the input pointers are equal.

If they are equal, the output will not result in a swap - but in the values being zero'd out.

After _enough_ calls to RC4 with this bug, the first 16 bytes of the RC4 sbox will become zero - which means the canary will also be zero and is therefore predictable (`x ^ x == 0` for any `x`).

## Writeup
A solve script can be found in ./solve

1. Send _enough_ requests to the service to zero out the RC4 sbox
2. _Predict_ the canary (`\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00`)
3. Send the canary and the 247DUCTF string _after_ the canary
